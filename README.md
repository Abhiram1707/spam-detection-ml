# spam-detection-ml
A machine learning project to classify emails as spam or not spam using natural language processing (NLP) and classification algorithms. This model helps in filtering unwanted emails by analyzing the content and identifying spam patterns.
This project focuses on detecting spam emails using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to train a model that can accurately classify whether a given email is spam or legitimate based on its textual content.

The dataset contains labeled email messages, which are processed through various NLP steps like tokenization, stemming, and vectorization (TF-IDF). After preprocessing, several classification algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) are applied and evaluated.

This project demonstrates a practical application of machine learning in cybersecurity and communication filtering. It's ideal for students and enthusiasts looking to explore text classification, email filtering, and NLP in Python.
